# Slack Security Policy
Slack is committed to treating our customers’ data with the utmost care. As part of this, we encourage security researchers to put our security to the test - and we offer a variety of rewards for doing so. We look forward to continuing to work with the community as we add new features and services.

If you’ve found a vulnerability, [submit it here](https://hackerone.com/slack).
